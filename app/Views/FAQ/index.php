              The Investment Idea Platform is a web-based platform that allows
              users to share and discover investment ideas. Users can submit
              their own investment ideas, as well as browse and vote on ideas
              submitted by others.

              Users can create an account and submit their investment idea,
              which will be reviewed by our team before it is published on the
              platform. Other users can then browse and vote on the idea, and
              the most popular ideas will be highlighted on the platform.

              quality and relevant to our users.
